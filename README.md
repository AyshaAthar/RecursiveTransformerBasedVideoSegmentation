## RecursiveTransformerBasedVideoSegmentation
Task: Video Semantic Segmentation.
Extend the paper that introduced [Segmenter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05633) to also work well for Video data. 

Essentially, a model that handles temporal relations well using transformers.

An overview of the model is given below -
